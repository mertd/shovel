# Shovel

 > Find [scoop](https://scoop.sh) manifests instantly from the comfort of your browser.

## Motivation

Scoop manifests can be hard to find via internet searches as their manifests often don't show up in the top results. At the same time, searching via scoop itself is rather slow.

The goal of this web app is to provide a fast and comfortable alternative.

## Development

Run with `npm run start`, test with `npm run test` and build with `npm run build`.

This app uses a `manifests.json` file generated and hosted in [shovel-data](https://github.com/mertd/shovel-data).

### Technologies

- Language: TypeScript
- SPA Framework: React
- UI Framework: Chakra UI
- Linter: ESLint
- Formatter: Prettier
